Shell Study Notes by Tiancheng Gong (TLCL Chapter 6)

What is a Command:
    1. An executable program like all those files we saw in /usr/bin. Within this category, programs can be compiled binaries such as programs written in C and C++, or programs written in scripting languages such as the shell, perl, python, ruby, etc.
    2. A command built into the shell itself. bash supports a number of commands internally called shell builtins. The cd command, for example, is a shell builtin.
    3. A shell function. These are miniature shell scripts incorporated into the environment. 
    4. An alias. Commands that we can define ourselves, built from other commands.
