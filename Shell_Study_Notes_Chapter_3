Shell Study Notes by Tiancheng Gong (TLCL Chapter 3)

pwd: print working directory

ls -- List all files under teh current directory
    hidden files start with '.', use 'ls -a' to show them

absolute path:
    start from the root directory, e.g. /usr/bin

relative path:
    start form the current directory (by adding './' or nothing),
        e.g. Say we are at /user, 'cd bin' = 'cd ./bin' = 'cd /usr/bin' (absolute path)
    start from the parent directory of the current directory (by adding '../')
        e.g. Say we are at /user, 'cd ../dev' = 'cd /dev' (absolute path)

cd: 
    cd: change directory
    cd -: change directory to the previous directory
    cd ~user_name: change directory to user_name's home directory
    cd ..: change directory to the parent directory
    cd ~: change directory to current user's home directory
