cp -- Copy files and directories
    cp Command Usage: cp SOURCE... DEST
    Option(Long Option): Description
    -a(--archive)      : Copy the files and directories and all of their attributes, including ownerships and permissions. Normally, copies take on the default attributes of the user performing the copy
    -i(--interactive)  : Before overwriting an existing file, prompt the user for confirmation. If this option is not specified, cp will silently overwrite files.
    -r(--recursive)    : Recursively copy directories and their contents. This option (or the -a option) is required when copying directories.
    -u(--update)       : When copying files from one directory to another, only copy files that either don't exist, or are newer than the existing corresponding files, in the destination directory.
    -v(--verbose)      : Display informative messages as the copy is performed.

mv -- Move/rename files and directories

mkdir -- Create directories

rm -- Remove (Rename) files and directories

ln -- Create hard and symbolic links
    ln [FILE] [LINK] -- hard link
        A hard link cannot reference a file outside its own file system. This means a link may not reference a file that is not on the same disk partition as the link itself.
        A hard link may not reference a directory.
    ln -s [ITEM] [LINK] -- soft link (symbolic link or symlink)

Difference between hard link and soft link:
    A hard link is the file itself with a different name or path -- A soft link is a file that refers to another file
    A hard link has the same inode as the original file -- A soft link itself has a new inode
    Call delete on the file that one hard link referring does not affect the visiting of another hard link on the same file (if another hard link exists) -- A soft link will refer to nothing if the same operation is applied.
