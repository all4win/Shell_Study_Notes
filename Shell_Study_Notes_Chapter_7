Shell Study Notes by Tiancheng Gong (TLCL Chapter 7)

I/O redirection:
    Standard Input (stdin): usually from keyboard
    Standard Output (stdout): usually to screen (terminal, console)
    Redirection: change the input source and output destination

'>':
    A redirection operator followed by the name of the output file
    Write standard output from the beginning of the file.
    Small trick: use '> [filename]' as create a new file (or re-write a existed file)

'>>':
    Append redirected output to a file instead of overwriting the file from the beginning.


file descriptor:
    Standard input, output and error == 0, 1, and 2

redirect err and stdout together:
    Approach 1: '[output] > [filename] 2>&1'
    Approach 2: '[output] &> [filename]' which is recommended

discard message:
    Redirect output to a special file called “/dev/null”. This file is a system device called a bit bucket which accepts input and does nothing with it.
    e.g. : '[output] 2> /dec/null'

pipe operator “|”:
    the standard output of one command can be piped into the standard input of another
    Usage: [source] | [dest]
    e.g.1: ls -l /usr/bin | less
    e.g.2: ls /bin /usr/bin | sort | less
