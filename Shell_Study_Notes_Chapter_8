echo: 
    Display a line of test.
    Works like print in c.
    But it will delete extra spaces between words if the arg is not with double quotes.

    eg: 
      echo *:
            Echo all file names in the current working directory
            But it doesn't reveal hidden files
      echo *s:
            Echo all file names that match the pattern "*s" in the current working directory (known as path extension)
      echo /usr/*/share:
            We can look beyond the current working directory
